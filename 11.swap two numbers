Question:
Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

Solution:
class Solution{   
public:
    pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        //complete the function here
        pair<int,int>p;
        p.first=b;
        p.second=a;
        return p;
        
    }
};

Explaination:
* As we have to return a pair we declare a pair
* next,we push b as the first element and a as the second element
p.first defines the first element and p.second defines the second element of the pair
*Now return the pair
