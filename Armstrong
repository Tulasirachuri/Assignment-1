Question:
For a given 3 digit number, find whether it is armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Return "Yes" if it is a armstrong number else return "No".
NOTE: 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371

Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    string armstrongNumber(int n){
        // code here
        int p,sum=0,s=n;
        while(n!=0)
        {
            p=n%10;
            sum+=pow(p,3);
            n=n/10;
        }
        if(sum==s)
            return "Yes";
        else
            return "No";
    }
};

Explaination:
* Given an integer n,get the individual digits by using % operator
* now make them to the power of 3 using pow(x,n) which is already predefined which gives x^n as the output 
* now we cube the digits and add them to the variable sum
* if the sum is equal to the given number then return yes 
* else return no
