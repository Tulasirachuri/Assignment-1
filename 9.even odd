Question:
Given a positive integer N, determine whether it is odd or even

Solution:
class Solution
{
  public:
    string oddEven(int N)
    {
      if(N%2==0)
          return "even";
      else
          return "odd";
    }
};

Explaination:
*We know that the numbers that are divisible by 2 are even and the others are odd
*So we check if n%2=0 return even else return odd
