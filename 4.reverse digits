Question:
You are given an integer N, reverse the digits of given number N, ensuring that the reversed number has no leading zeroes. 
Return the resulting reversed number

Solution:
long long int reverse_digit(long long int n)
		{
		    // Code here
		    int p;
		    long long sum=0;
		    while(n!=0)
		    {
		        p=n%10;
		        sum=sum*10+p;
		        n=n/10;
		    }
		    return sum;
		}

Explaination:
* First declare a variable p,sum
* here p is to store the remainder at each iteration
* next iterate the loop until n becomes 0 and get the remainder at each iteration
* now multiply the sum by 10 at each itartion
* return sum
