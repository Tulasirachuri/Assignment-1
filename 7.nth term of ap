Question:
Given the first 2 terms a1 and a2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the nth term of the series

Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthTermOfAP(int a1, int a2, int n) {
        // code here
        int d=a2-a1;
        int p=a1+(n-1)*d;
        return p;
    }
};

Explaination:
given first two terms of ap first we find the difference d between them 
we know the nth term of an ap is a+(n-1)d where a is the first term,d is the common difference
so the nth term is calculated using the above formula
