Question:
Create the multiplication table of a given number N and return the table as an array


Solution
class Solution
{
public:
    vector<int> getTable(int N)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
        int i=1;
        vector<int> t;
        while(i<11)
        {
            t.push_back(N*i);
            i++;
        }
        return t;
    }
};

Explaination:
* As we have to return the answer in vector format first we declare a vector 
* Then we iterate a variable i from 1 to 10
* for every i we multiply n with i and push the value into the vector
*Now return the vector
