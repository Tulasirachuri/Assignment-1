Question:
Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms)

Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    long long seriesSum(int n) {
        // code here
        long long sum=static_cast<long long> (n+1)*n/2;
        return sum;
    }
};

Explaination:
Given a number n,to calculate the sum of series upto n,i have used the sum of first n natural numbers sum=n*(n+1)2 and return sum
here,I have used a casting operator ie static_cast<long long> which converts the product into the type long long
