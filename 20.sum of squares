Question:
Given a single integer N, your task is to find the sum of the square of the first N even natural Numbers.

Solution:
class Solution
{
  public:
    long long int sum_of_square_evenNumbers(long long int n)
    {
      int i=0,p=0;
      long long sum=0;
      while(p<n)
      {
        i+=2;
        p++;
        sum+=i*i;
      }
      return sum;
    }
  }

Explaination:
* Initialize variables i (to track even numbers), p (to track the count of even numbers), and sum (to store the sum of squares).
* While the count p is less than n, repeat the following steps:
* Increment i by 2 to get the next even number.
* Increment the count p.
* Add the square of i to the sum.
* After the loop ends, return the computed sum.
