Question:
You are given a cubic dice with 6 faces. All the individual faces have a number printed on them. 
The numbers are in the range of 1 to 6, like any ordinary dice. 
You will be provided with a face of this cube,
your task is to guess the number on the opposite face of the cube

Solution:
class Solution
{
public:
    int oppositeFaceOfDice(int N)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
       return 7-N;
    }
};

Explaination:
* We know that sum of the opposite faces of dice is 7
* So as we know one face of the dice(n) then we return 7-n
