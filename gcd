Question:
Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        int i=1;
        int gc=1;
        if(b==a+1)
            return 1;
        while(i<=a)
        {
            if(a%i==0 && b%i==0)
            {
                gc=i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return gc;
    }
};

Explaination:
I have used the above solution but it is not true for all the test cases

First i have initialised gcd=1 because when there is no common factor 1 is the gcd
starting  with i=1 we check if it is a common factor of both a and b 
if it is a common factor we make that i as gcd
after iterating i upto a we return gcd
